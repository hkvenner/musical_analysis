# musical_analysis
 
 In this project I used Python’s Pandas library to combine datasets for the top Spotify songs from 2010-2019. Each year’s songs are in their own CSV file and needed to be combined into a single dataset. After the datasets were combined, there were some questions to answer to dive into the data a bit more.
